Progress: Restored end-to-end fact‑check by hardening Exa calls (header/payload fallbacks, normalization) and rewired the detector path; resolved 402s and “unverifiable due to no sources.”
Design: Introduced an elegant gradient score ring and readable, stacked claim cards with source chips—aligning the fact‑check view with Rauno’s refined depth and hierarchy.

Next: claim-card stagger + source-chip micro‑hover.
